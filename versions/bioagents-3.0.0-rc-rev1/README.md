# bioagents-3.0.0-rc-rev1

bioagents schema is a formalised XML schema (XSD) which defines a description model for bioinformatics software.  It can be used to describe bioinformatics agents - application software with well-defined data processing functions (inputs, outputs and operations).   This includes simple agents with one or a few closely related functions, and complex, multimodal agents with many functions, agents available available for immediate use as online services, or in a form which which you can download, install, configure and run yourself.  

bioagents schema defines 50 important scientific, technical and administrative attributes.  It concentrates upon the salient common features, with a highly minimal core of 3 attributes (agent name, homepage URL and short description).

 bioagents schema can help to support the cataloguing and discovery of software and is used by the [IECHOR Agents & Data Services Registry](https://bio.agents).
