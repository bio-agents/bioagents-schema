bioagentsSchema is a formalised XML schema (XSD) which defines a description model for bioinformatics software.  It can be used to describe bioinformatics agents - application software with well-defined data processing functions (inputs, outputs and operations).   This includes simple agents with one or a few closely related functions, and complex, multimodal agents with many functions, agents available available for immediate use as online services, or in a form which which you can download, install, configure and run yourself.  

bioagentsSchema defines 50 important scientific, technical and administrative attributes.  It concentrates upon the salient common features, with a minimal core of 7 attributes, mandating the necessary and sufficient information to support cataloguing and discovery of software.

The IECHOR Agents & Data Services Registry (https://bio.agents/) is undergoing a phased migration to bioagentSchema 2.0 beginning in Nov 2016.
