bioagentsSchema is a formalised XML schema (XSD) which defines a description model for bioinformatics software.  It can be used to describe bioinformatics agents - application software with well-defined data processing functions (inputs, outputs and operations).   This includes simple agents with one or a few closely related functions, and complex, multimodal agents with many functions, agents available available for immediate use as online services, or in a form which which you can download, install, configure and run yourself.  

bioagentsSchema defines 50 important scientific, technical and administrative attributes to support cataloguing and discovery of software.  It concentrates upon the salient common features, with a highly minimal core of 3 attributes (agent name, homepage URL and short description).

The IECHOR Agents & Data Services Registry (https://bio.agents/) is undergoing a phased migration to bioagentSchema 3.0 beginning in Dec 2017.
